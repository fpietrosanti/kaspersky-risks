Risk Evaluation of Kaspersky related Risk, if subject to Coercion by Russian Government for Intelligence and Military Purposes


Brainstorming on possible tactical and strategic advantage of Russian Security Agencies compelling Kaspersky for cooperation:

* Acquire all databases of endusers (Cloud Scanning and Endpoint) for tactical and strategical planning of future attack
* Acquire all meta-data of endusers (Cloud Scanning and Endpoint) to create a detailed data-taxonomy in the planning of future attacks
* Disable the functionality of Updates on a targeted basis (only some specific endpoint or company or networks)
* Disable the functionality of Protection on a targeted basis (only some specific endpoint or company or networks)
* Search and Seize parametric-targeted data (Cloud Scanning and Endpoint)
* Delivery of a malicious updates on a generalized basis (massive updates)
* Delivery of a malicious updates on a targeted basis (only some specific endpoint or company or networks)

Means to delivery of malicious updates:
* Direct Backdoor Delivery: Download of a new malicious executable - Easy to be detected
* Indirect Bugdoor Delivery: Delivery of detection patterns updates, that trigger a complex exploit, leading to code execution - Survive Source Code Analysis 

The Detection Risks for Russian Security Agencies is proportionate to how wide their actions in compelling Kaspersky could be:
* For Cloud Scanning and Database Acquisition 100% of actions could be done without possibility of detection by endusers
* For Targeted Actions, there's very minimal possibilty of detections, being the Endpoint Protection Software in charge of detecting abuses, and not being present other software capable to detect Bug Door

Actually the Transparency Centers methods, including one-off source code analysis, fail to deliver protection against all of the risks above represented:
* Source code inspection to detect Bugdoor would require many man working years of seniors security engineers
* Review of any software release, with analysis and re-inspection of code changes following a deterministic build, would require many man working years of senior security engineers to be effective
* Technical Operations of Backend Infrastructure, Changes in the way data are processed and/or who's entitled to access those data, can't be oversee by endusers.

Concluding, t's not possible trough Transparency Center to provide Security Gurantees against Russian Security Agencies coercion for cooperation.

In order to assess the risks of coercion from Russian Government of Russian Management, Owners, R&S and Technical Operations we have to evaluate whenever Kaspersky is a Russian Company or not:
* Is Kaspersky a company who's Directors and Owners lives in Russia? Yes
* Is Kaspersky a company who's majority of employee lives in russia? Yes
* Is Kaspersky main market Russia? Yes* (According to Deposited Balancesheet roughly more than 40% of Credit is "CIS and Baltic")
* Is the Kaspersky UK holding company fully owned and fully managed (directors) by Russian Resident and Russian Citizens? Yes

Starting from the assumption above, Kaspersky is a Russian Company that can be victim of coercion from Russian Government.

Note: Also Apple and Google has been victim of coercion from Russian Government, with Moscow based executive being harrassed by the FSB up until they required their U.S. employee to remove the Navalny app https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/world/europe/russia-navalny-app-election.html
